# HTTP Basic Authentication
Adds Basic Authentication Moodle.
The plugin is designed to work in the environment of Moodle 3.2+.

It is worthwhile to understand the motives and reasons before installing the plug-in, because:
 * You can not login to the authorization page.
Consequently, the ability to register and restore the password for users will be lost.
 * HTTP Basic Authentication is the least secure authorization system, because authorization keys are transmitted in clear text.
Use a secure HTTPS protocol to protect user information.
